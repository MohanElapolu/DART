## Team Informatoin
The artifacts are allocated across three teams: ECU, HCU, and SS. Each team receives a specific set of artifacts. Some artifacts are shared between multiple teams, requiring collaboration for documentation. This folder contains the descriptions of the artifacts and detailed distribution information.
